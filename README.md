# Contributing

You can contribute anything you want. Content, bug fixes, even custom code. Simply clone the repository, and let me know if you need help. The original 2006redone release thread might come in handy for starting out: https://www.rune-server.ee/runescape-development/rs2-server/downloads/655403-2006redone-release-highly-accurate-runescape-2006-remake.html

Folder layout:

2006Redone file_server must be running so the client can connect and get the cache

2006Redone Server contains the server code

2006Redone Client contains the client code

Note that while any sensible changes are welcome, refactoring the Client is unlikely to be merged, simply because it breaks the botting hooks.

Bot client available through Parabot.org: https://www.parabot.org/community/
